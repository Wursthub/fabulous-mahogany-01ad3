This project was born out of the desperation to bridge the gap to business at the end of the PhD studies. Together with Ugur Sezer, a quantum physicist I collaborated with at the time, we developed this idea during a startup incubator. Together we learned basic business skills and applied lean methodology during 150+ customer interviews conducted within 6 months: Not wasting any money on building anything before not thorougly understanding the problem. 



### The Problem & Solution

Neuroscience and quantum physics often requires the use of dangerous and often invisible lasers which can leave holes in the walls. The protective goggles are heavy, expensive and make the light you want to work with invisible while still being able to be penetrated by lasers of other colors. 

> Did you know that companies have to spend hundreds of millions of euros each year for laser safety goggles which in the end nobody wants to wear? We want to transform this annoying cost factor into a thing people WANT to wear. With our solution we improve the users visibility and display digital parameters 

The best protection would be having no photons from the outside hitting your eyes. By blocking the light path with camera lenses and showing the outside world only via augmented reality protects from all light, enables digital head-up displays and even visualizes infrared and UV-light due to the camera sensors sensitivity in these regions.

### The Team

Without the help of my genious friends and lots of free time this idea would have not been possible

*   Ugur Sezer - customer development, business development

*   Philipp Geyer - basic technology prototype

*   Christoph GÃ¶tz - customer development, business development

### The Result

*   Admitted to prestigeous high-tech incubator [Inits](https://www.inits.at/en/home/). 9 Month program, financial support and goverment grants

*   150+ customer interviews, patent research, profit loss calulation, Bill of materials, supplier evaluation etc. 

*    Communication strategy, pitching, business models, 

### Lessons Learned
