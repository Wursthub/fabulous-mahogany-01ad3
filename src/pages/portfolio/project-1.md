### The Problem

As an interdisciplinary scientist. even finding the right word to search for is not easy if you are unfamiliar with a new topic or field. When reading a paper, searching for relevant sections using CTRL+F is too dumb. Searching for "feeding" won't show potentially relevant sections like "nutrition".

### The Goal

A smart search engine that facilitates finding semantically similar terms and reduces search time instead of guessing terms for CTRL+F

### The Team

*   Christoph GÃ¶tz: Conception, data and model

*   James Dommisse: Backend

*   Johannes Schuh: Frontend

### The Result

*   Scraped and tokenized 100k+ scientific papers from Pubmed et al

*   Vectorized the topics using [Gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/) (word2vec)

*   Website to copy text to form, search for string and highligh semantically similar terms with thresholding
