Growing up on the countryside I always loved nature. My parents are hobby botanists and genuinly cared for human beings and the world we live in. I continue this path by trying to understand natures design principles and applying these to scaleable technology to make the world a more awesome place.

This website is a rough collection of things I did and do to share the knowledge and inspire others to go a similar path.
