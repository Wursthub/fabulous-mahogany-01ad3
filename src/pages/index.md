      I like science, high-tech, music and photography. Currently, I help
      building AI to facilitate early diagnosis of musculoskeletal disease for
      over a billion patients worldwide.

      - title: Science
        content: >
          I studied physics and the quantum world to understand what information
          is and the limits of knowledge. Neuro- and molecularbiology thought me
          about perception and information processing. AI enables me to
          experimentally reconstruct human knowledge in a mathematical model.
      - title: High-Tech
        content: >
          Science is just a tool-set to understand the world. Putting it to
          practice to make the world a better place while inspiring others to do
          the same is extremely motivating.

        content: >
          I spent most of the teens in rehearsal rooms playing drums and piano.
          Nowadays, I program jazzy-elektronika at home and sometimes play live
          with friends in Vienna.
      - title: Photography
        content: >
          Using photography to elevate mundane objects or moments to show their
          inherent beauty is what I try while traveling. This way I focus much
          more on the moment and create stronger memories at the same time.
