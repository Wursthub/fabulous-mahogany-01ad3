    title: 'Hi, I''m Christoph GÃ¶tz.'
    content: >
      I am a creator and an explorer. Science, high-tech, music and photography
      is what I am most curious about. Currently, I help building AI to
      facilitate early diagnosis of musculoskeletal disease for over a billion
      patients worldwide.

        content: >
          I studied physics and the quantum world to understand what information
          is. Neuro- and molecularbiology thought me about perception and
          information processing. AI enables me to tinker with human knowledge.
      - title: High-Tech
        content: >
          Science is just a tool-set to understand the world. Putting it to
          practice to make the world a better place while inspiring others to do
          the same is extremely motivating.

        content: >
          I spent most of the teens in rehearsal rooms playing drums and piano.
          Nowadays, I program jazzy-elektronika at home and sometimes play live
          with friends in Vienna.
      - title: Photography
        content: >
          Using photography to elevate mundane objects or moments to show their
          inherent beauty is what I try while traveling. This way I focus much
          more on the moment and create stronger memories at the same time.
